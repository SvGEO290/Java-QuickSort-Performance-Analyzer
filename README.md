# Java QuickSort Performance Analyzer
 
This repository contains a Java program designed to implement the QuickSort algorithm for sorting arrays of random integers. The primary objectives of this assignment were to enhance Java programming skills, gain insights into Divide and Conquer sorting algorithms, practice Javadoc documentation, and reinforce good programming techniques.

QuickSort Implementation:
Implemented QuickSort for integer arrays, with flexibility to choose between pivot picking strategies:

Specific element (first/middle/last)
Median of 3
Random element as a pivot
Visualized the QuickSort process for each pivot strategy using a set of 15 random integers. The array was printed after each partitioning step but before recursive calls to QuickSort.

Performance Analysis:
Introduced code to compare the performance of different pivot picking strategies by measuring the time it takes to sort arrays of increasing sizes.
Used methods such as System.nanoTime() or Instant.now() for precise elapsed time measurements.
Conducted multiple trials (e.g., 3) for each array size and calculated the average runtime.
Compiled timing results into a table for documentation.
Observations:
Provided a section in the write-up to share observations and insights based on the performance comparison.
Created a simple graph to visually represent and compare the efficiency of the three pivot picking strategies.
Instructions for Use:
Compile and Run:
